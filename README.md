# Project Name: Dataset Classification App

To complete the requirement for the Master of Software Engineering program at Birzeit University, this dataset classifications application were implemented and deployed as part of the master’s thesis preparation, 

## What is Dataset Classifiction App?
This .NET Framework project, integrated with SQL Server, includes an imported dataset of Google play user reviews collected from various apps domains such as health, finance, sports, and telecommunications.
The application allows users to manually classify, label, and annotate these reviews according to key classes non-functional requirements, which were used in my master’s thesis to train models based on the classified data.

### Thesis topic: Identifying Non-Functional Requirements from Mobile Apps User’s Reviews using Deep Learning
### Supervisor: Dr. Abualseoud Hanani
### Student name: Nasri Ladaa

<br>

#### Used Non-functional requirements (classes) are as below:

##### Usability
Degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. Example: ”I have to navigate into three pages before reach my appointment page”


#### Reliability
Degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time. Example: “After clicking on start call button the app crashes”


#### Portability
Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a system, product or component can be transferred from one hardware, software or other operational or usage environment to another. Example: “On my tablet it worked fine but on the phone nothing appeared”


#### Performance
Performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions.

Example:“ I have to wait 10 seconds to see all my notifications”
Learnability
Degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals of learning to use the product or system with effectiveness, efficiency, freedom from risk and satisfaction in a specified context of use. Example:“I used many similar apps all of them have quick tutorial to get started”


#### Compatibility
Degree to which a product, system or component can exchange information with other products, systems or components, and/or perform its required functions, while sharing the same hardware or software environment. Example:“My live match are not synced with FIFA official schedule”


##### Security
Degree to which a product or system protects information and data so that persons or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization. Example:“This app allow weak password”


#### Functional Requirements
Things that system shall allow, be able to do, may be able to do. Example:“Can you add Call ambulance button so we can make emergency calls faster”


#### Others
Include emotional expressions and not related functional or nonfunctional requirements. Example:“Cool”, “I like this App.”
